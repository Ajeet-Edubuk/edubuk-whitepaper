offline learning modules. This dynamic plan adapts continuously to the learner’s progress, ensuring 
the acquisition of skills most relevant to their chosen career path.

As learners progress through their personalized learning plans, they evolve into skilled professionals 
equipped with the necessary competencies and expertise required for success in their selected 
careers. 

**5. Digital Record on Blockchain:**
 
Every achievement, skill acquisition, and certification is securely recorded on the blockchain, creating 
an immutable and transparent digital record. This ensures all credentials are easily verifiable and trusted by potential employers and academic institutions.
