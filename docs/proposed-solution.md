### AI-Driven MIIT Screening 
The Multiple Intelligences and Interests Types (MIIT) Screening employs a sophisticated AI-driven approach to career guidance by integrating psychometric assessments with advanced machine learning algorithms. This system maps an individual’s cognitive abilities, emotional intelligence, and interests to identify optimal career paths. AI algorithms utilize extensive data sets to uncover complex patterns that traditional methods fail to detect, delivering highly accurate career recommendations. The AI-driven MIIT screening process is implemented using the following algorithm: 
 
**Algorithm 1** AI-Driven MIIT Screening 
 
- **Input:** Psychometric Test Results P , Cognitive Data C, Emotional Data E 
- **Output:** Career Path CP 
- Calculate intelligence quotient IQ from C 
- Analyze emotional stability ES from E 
- Match IQ and ES with career paths in database D 
- Generate CP based on highest compatibility **return** CP
